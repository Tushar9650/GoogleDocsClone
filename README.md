## Implementation
To implement the Google Docs frontend interface using ReactJS, you can follow these steps:

Set up a new React project by creating a new directory and running the following command in your terminal:
Open the project in your preferred code editor.

Install any required dependencies. In this case, you might need to install additional libraries such as react-router-dom for handling routing and react-icons for using icons. Run the following command:

Create the necessary components for different sections of the Google Docs frontend interface. For example, you can create a DocumentToolbar component, FormattingToolbar component, ToolsMenu component, etc. Organize these components in a suitable folder structure within the src directory.

Define the structure and layout of the interface using JSX syntax in your component files. Use HTML tags, React components, and CSS classes to style and structure the interface elements.

Implement the necessary functionality for each component. For example, you can handle click events, state management, and interactions with the backend APIs if needed. You can also use React hooks to manage component state and lifecycle methods.

Set up routing if required. You can define routes using react-router-dom and create separate components for different pages or sections of the Google Docs interface.

Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components to style your components and make them visually appealing.

Test your components and ensure they work as expected. You can use the built-in testing tools in React or libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to write unit tests.

Once you are satisfied with your implementation, run the following command in the project directory to start the development server and view your Google Docs interface in a web browser:
